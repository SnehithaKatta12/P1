I have built an Amazon clone webpage using HTML and CSS by following a YouTube tutorial as this is my first project. This project helped me understand the basics of web development, including building a webpage and styling it effectively.
Features of this project:Header,  Navigation bar with search box , Product listing with images , Footer.
